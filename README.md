The files used to extract the train, dev and test sets are under <b><i> QA_data/semEval_data/ </i></b>...  to extract the queries and relevant information for preprocessing simply go into the directory <b><i>feature_extraction/</b></i> and run :

          >> python run.py
          
the extracted queries and other data will be dumped in <b><i>QA_data/data_dumps/</i></b>
